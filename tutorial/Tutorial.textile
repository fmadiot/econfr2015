The instructions start from a basic modeling tool that is the result of the Sirius "Starter Tutorial":https://wiki.eclipse.org/Sirius/Tutorials/4MinTutorial. This starting modeling tool just allows you to create diagrams which represent Men and Women linked by parental relationships. From this diagram you can also use the palette to create Men.

These instructions are based on a simple Domain Model which describes basic concepts about families.

The modeling workbench created with this tutorial will allow users to visualize the members of a family and their parental relationships on a graphical diagram. It will also provide tools to edit the model from the diagram.

h3. The sample Domain Model

A modeling workbench allows users to create or visualize models of a given Domain Model defined with EMF (Ecore model).

This tutorial relies on a Domain Model (DSL) defining the basic concepts of families:

* A family is composed of several persons.
* Persons are men or women.
* A person has:
** a name,
** children,
** two parents
** a father and a mother.
!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/0/05/Sirius_4mtuto_02.png!

The domain model is implemented with several EMF projects that you need to import into your workspace.
Import these projetcs from the git repository : _File > Import... > Git > Projects from Git > Existing local repository > econfr2015 > Import existing Eclipse projects_. And select only the following projects:
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily = Metamodel
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.edit = Edit generated by EMF
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.editor = Editor generated by EMF

h3. Sirius development environment

h4. Launch a new runtime from your Eclipse

To launch a new eclipse application click on _Run / Run Configurations_ and double click on_ Eclipse Application_ to get a New_configuration. In order to comfortably run Sirius in your new runtime, you should add this option in your VM arguments :

@-XX:MaxPermSize=256m@
!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/d/d0/Sirius_4mtuto_03.png!

h4. Select the Sirius perspective

In the new Eclipse runtime, select the Sirius perspective.

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/8/8f/Sirius_4mtuto_06.png!

This perspective provides specific Sirius menus and a new kind of project (_Modeling Project_). A Modeling Project contains models and the corresponding graphical representations created with Sirius.

h4. Import a sample model and a basic odesign

A sample model is available from the git repository _File > Import... > Git > Projects from Git > Existing local repository > econfr2015 > Import existing Eclipse projects_. And select only the following projects:
* basifamily.sample = Model instance
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.design = Sirius specification project

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/e/e7/Sirius_4mtuto_04-1.png!

The wizard then installs a _Modeling Project_ containing a file named _example.basicfamily_.

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/9/99/Sirius_4mtuto_05-2.png!

Double-clicking on this sample model opens a tree editor generated by EMF.

This editor allows you to see the properties and relationships of the model elements.

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/d/de/Sirius_4mtuto_11.png!

A basic designer exists which already displays Men, Women and child relationship. It also provides a tool to create Men.

Install this tool from the examples provided with Sirius. (TODO)

Before starting to extend this tool, first use it to create a diagram on the sample model: you will see this diagram evolve progressively with new features during this tutorial.

To activate this tool, open the _Viewpoints Selection_ wizard on the modeling project containing the sample model.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-01.png!

Then select the _persons_ viewpoint.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-02.png!

Now you can create a diagram on the Family object: menu _New Representation_.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-03.png!

h2. Start the tutorial

The first step of this tutorial consists in completing the basic modeler with a tool to create Women also.

Copy and paste the tool CreateMan, then replace Man by Woman:
* in the *Id* of the tool
* in the *Node Mappings* of the tool (use the wizard to select WomanNode)  
* in the *Create Instance* operation (under the Begin section)

!./images/sirius_tuto2_03-01.png!

h3(#Edge_Creation_Tool). Edge Creation Tool

An Edge Creation tool allows the user to create relationships directly from the diagram, by using the palette.

Let's use this tool to allow the user to set the father and the mother of a person.

Let's use this tool to allow the user to set the father and the mother of a person.

Right click on the Section and select the menu 'New Element Creation > Edge Creation'

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-01.png!

Give an Id to this tool (setFather) and associate it to fatherEdge, the Edge Mapping which defines the father graphical relation.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-02.png!

Then define the operations that will be performed by this tool each time the user will click on it. These operations can use four variables that are automatically set by Sirius:
* **source**: the first object on which the user has clicked (the source of the relation is is going to create)
* **target**: the second object on which the user has clicked (the target of the relation is is going to 
* **sourceView**: the graphical object representing the source
* **targetView**: the graphical object representing the target

Under the _Begin_ object, create a _Change Context_ and set its _Browse Expression_ to _var:source_ in order to define the execution context of the next operations.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-03.png!

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-04.png!

Under the _Change Context_ create a _Set_ which will set the _father_ of the first Person clicked (source) to the second Person clicked (target):
* Feature Name: father
* value Expression: var:target 

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-05.png!

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-06.png!

Save the _odesign_ file and you will see a new tool _setFather_ in the palette.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-07.png!

h4. Precondition

To prevent the user to create a father relationship from a person to itself, or to one of its children, you can add a precondition expression (written in Acceleo 3).

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-08.png!

This expression uses to new variables:
* **preSource**: the object on which the user has clicked first
* **preTarget**: the object under the cursor

With this precondition, the tool will prevent the creation of forbidden links by showing a specific icon.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_04-09.png!

Then copy, paste and update this tool to create the _setMother_ tool.

h3(#Reconnect_Edge_Tool). Reconnect Edge Tool

A Reconnect Edge tool allows the user to change the end of a relationship by moving it directly from the diagram.

Let's create a reconnect edge tool to change the father and the mother of a person.

Right click on the Section and select the menu 'New Element Edition > Reconnect Edge'

!./images/sirius_tuto2_05-01.png!

Associate the fatherEdge to this reconnect tool.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_05-02.png!

This tool comes with six variables:
* **source**: the object currently attached to the moved end
* **target**: the object going to be attached to the moved end
* **sourceView**: the graphical object representing source
* **targetView**: the graphical object representing target
* **element**: the object attached to the other end
* **elementView**: the graphical object representing element

Then create a _Change Context_ and set its expression to _var:element_ (the person who will change its father) 

Finally, create a _Set_ to assign the new selected parent (_var:target_) as _father_ of this person.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_05-03.png!

Copy, paste and update this tool to create a reconnect tool for _mother_ relationship.

A Reconnect Edge tool allows the user to change the end of a relationship by moving it directly from the diagram.

Let's create a reconnect edge tool to change the father and the mother of a person.

Right click on the Section and select the menu 'New Element Edition > Reconnect Edge'

sirius_tuto2_05_01.png

Associate the fatherEdge to this reconnect tool.

sirius_tuto2_05_02.png

This tool comes with six variables:
* **source**: the object currently attached to the moved end
* **target**: the object going to be attached to the moved end
* **sourceView**: the graphical object representing source
* **targetView**: the graphical object representing target
* **element**: the object attached to the other end
* **elementView**: the graphical object representing element

Then create a _Change Context_ and set its expression to _var:element_ (the person who will change its father) 

Finally, create a _Set_ to assign the new selected parent (_var:target_) as _father_ of this person.

sirius_tuto2_05-03.png

Copy, paste and update this tool to create a reconnect tool for _mother_ relationship.

To see the result have a look on the commit : @e284dac Reconnect edge tool@


h3(#Delete_Element_Tool). Delete Element Tool

A Delete Element tool specifies which actions have to be performed when the user hits the delete key on an diagram element.

It is necessary on elements which deletion can't be interpreted by Sirius (for example edges) or if you need to perform specific actions.

Let's create a delete element tool to specify what to do when the user deletes a paretal relation.

Right click on the Section and select the menu 'New Element Edition > Delete Element'

!./images/sirius_tuto2_06-01.png!

Associate the fatherEdge to this delete tool.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_06-02.png

When deleting a edge, the variable **element** refers to the source of the relationship.

So, create a _Change Context_ and set its expression to _var:element_ (the person which is the children). Then create a _Unset_ on the feature _father_ to remove this relation.


!./images/sirius_tuto2_06-03.png!

Copy, paste and update this tool to create a delete tool for _mother_ relationship.

To see the result have a look on the commit : @7395295 Delete element tool@

h3(#Direct_Edit_Label_Tool). Direct Edit Label Tool

A Direct Edit Label specifies how to interpret the modification of graphical object's label in order to modify the model. 

Let's create a Direct Edit Label to change the name of a Person directly from the diagram.

Right click on the Section and select the menu 'New Element Edition > Direct Edit Label'

!./images/sirius_tuto2_07-01.png!

Associate this tool to the objects which have a name: _ManNode_ and _WomanNode_

!./images/sirius_tuto2_07-02.png!

This tool comes with a mask that creates variables depending on the label's value. By default, the mask is set to {O}, which means that the variable named _0_ will contain the full value of the label.  

Create a _Set_ to indicate the feature of the edited object that will be modified (_name_) and the value to assign (_var:0_).

!./images/sirius_tuto2_07-03.png!

To see the result have a look on the commit : @05812f4 Direct edit label tool@

h3(#SVG). SVG

Sirius supports SVG images to improve the quality of the diagrams.

Because the current designer uses PNG images, resizing a Man or Woman on a diagram causes the pixelation of images.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_08-01.png!

Add _man.svg_ and _woman.svg_ in the _icons_ folder. TODO These SVG images are available on TODO.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_08-02.png!

Then replace these PNG images set to the styles of _ManNode_ and _WomanNode_ by SVG images. 

!./images/sirius_tuto2_08-03.png!

Close and re-open the diagram to allow Sirius to take the modification into account: now the images are no more pixelated.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_08-04.png!
