Then unzip ObeoDesigner-Community-7.0-xxx.xxx.xxx.zip

h3. Clone the tutorial Git repository

To clone "the tutorial git repository":https://github.com/mbats/econfr2015/:
* just download and unzip the provided zip: "econfr2015.zip":http://melb.enix.org/pub/econfr2015/econfr2015.zip
* or clone it from the command line: @git clone @https://github.com/mbats/econfr2015.git@
* or clone it from Obeo Designer 7 with EGit: 
File > Import...:
!./images/sirius_tuto2_00-01.png!

Git > Projects from Git:
!./images/sirius_tuto2_00-02.png!

Clone URI:
!./images/sirius_tuto2_00-03.png!

Set @https://github.com/mbats/econfr2015.git@ in the field @URI@:
!./images/sirius_tuto2_00-04.png!
Then press _Next_ and select only the metamodel's related projects (see the next "Import the sample Domain Model projects":#Domain_Model section).

h3(#Domain_Model). Import the sample Domain Model projects

A modeling workbench allows users to create or visualize models of a given Domain Model defined with EMF (Ecore model).

This tutorial relies on a Domain Model (DSL) defining the basic concepts of families:

* A family is composed of several persons.
* Persons are men or women.
* A person has:
** a name,
** children,
** two parents,
** a father and a mother.
!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/0/05/Sirius_4mtuto_02.png!

The domain model is implemented with several EMF projects that you need to import into your workspace.
Import these projects from the Git repository : File > Import...
!./images/sirius_tuto2_00-01.png!

Select _Git > Projects from Git_
!./images/sirius_tuto2_00-02.png!

Select _Existing local repository_
!./images/sirius_tuto2_01-01.png!

Select @econfr2015@
!./images/sirius_tuto2_01-02.png!

Select _Import existing Eclipse projects_
!./images/sirius_tuto2_01-03.png!

And select only the following projects:
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily = Metamodel
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.edit = Edit generated by EMF
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.editor = Editor generated by EMF
!./images/sirius_tuto2_01-04.png!

At the end your current environment should look like this:
!./images/sirius_tuto2_01-05.png!

h3. Open the Sirius development environment

h4. Launch a new runtime from your Eclipse

To launch a new eclipse application click on _Run / Run Configurations_ and double click on _Eclipse Application_ to get a @New_configuration@. In order to comfortably run Sirius in your new runtime, you should add this option in your VM arguments :

@-XX:MaxPermSize=256m@

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/d/d0/Sirius_4mtuto_03.png!

h4. Select the Sirius perspective

In the new Eclipse runtime, select the Sirius perspective.

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/8/8f/Sirius_4mtuto_06.png!

This perspective provides specific Sirius menus and a new kind of project (_Modeling Project_). A Modeling Project contains models and the corresponding graphical representations created with Sirius.

h4. Import a sample model and a basic odesign

A sample model is available from the git repository _File > Import... > Git > Projects from Git > Existing local repository > Add...> econfr2015 > Import existing Eclipse projects_. And select only the following projects:
* basifamily.sample = Model instance
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.design = Sirius specification project

!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-00.png!

Finally, your development environment should look like :
!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-00-1.png!

The wizard then installs a _Modeling Project_ containing a file named _example.basicfamily_.

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/9/99/Sirius_4mtuto_05-2.png!

Double-clicking on this sample model opens a tree editor generated by EMF.

This editor allows you to see the properties and relationships of the model elements.

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/d/de/Sirius_4mtuto_11.png!

A basic designer exists which already displays Men, Women and child relationship. It also provides a tool to create Men.

This designer is available in the project :
!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-00-2.png!

Before starting to extend this tool, first use it to create a diagram on the sample model: you will see this diagram evolve progressively with new features during this tutorial.

To activate this tool, open the _Viewpoints Selection_ wizard on the modeling project containing the sample model.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-01.png!

Then select the _persons_ viewpoint.

!./images/sirius_tuto2_02-02.png!

Now you can create a diagram on the Family object: menu _New Representation_.
