h1. Sirius Workshop: Advanced graphical editors for your DSL

h2. Overview

This tutorial explains how to create your first modeling workbench with Sirius.

These instructions are based on a simple Domain Model which describes basic concepts about families.

The modeling workbench created with this tutorial will allow users to visualize the members of a family and their parental relationships on a graphical diagram. It will also provide tools to edit the model from the diagram.

h3. The sample Domain Model

A modeling workbench allows users to create or visualize models of a given Domain Model defined with EMF (Ecore model).

This tutorial relies on a Domain Model (DSL) defining the basic concepts of families:

* A family is composed of several persons.
* Persons are men or women.
* A person has:
** a name,
** children,
** two parents
** a father and a mother.

The domain model is implemented with several EMF projects that you need to import into your workspace.
Import these projetcs from the git repository : _File > Import... > Git > Projects from Git > Existing local repository > econfr2015 > Import existing Eclipse projects. And select only the following projects:
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily = Metamodel
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.edit = Edit generated by EMF
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.editor = Editor generated by EMF

h3. Sirius development environment

h4. Launch a new runtime from your Eclipse

To launch a new eclipse application click on _Run / Run Configurations_ and double click on_ Eclipse Application_ to get a New_configuration. In order to comfortably run Sirius in your new runtime, you should add this option in your VM arguments :

@-XX:MaxPermSize=256m@

h4. Select the Sirius perspective

In the new Eclipse runtime, select the Sirius perspective.

This perspective provides specific Sirius menus and a new kind of project (_Modeling Project_). A Modeling Project contains models and the corresponding graphical representations created with Sirius.

h4. Import a sample model and a basic odesign

A sample model is available from the git repository _File > Import... > Git > Projects from Git > Existing local repository > econfr2015 > Import existing Eclipse projects_. And select only the following projects:
* basifamily.sample = Model instance
* org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basifamily.design = Sirius specification project

!https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/e/e7/Sirius_4mtuto_04-1.png!

The wizard then installs a _Modeling Project_ containing a file named _example.basicfamily_.

Double-clicking on this sample model opens a tree editor generated by EMF.

This editor allows you to see the properties and relationships of the model elements.

A basic designer is provided which defines mappings for Men, Women, child relationship and tool to create Men.
